1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Alright, so get this. We've got a stack of

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,160
intel on this guy.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,420
Moustafa Elhadary articles,

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,600
social media posts, even a peek

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,400
into his Y Combinator application,

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,340
which, by the way, is like trying to get into an

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,460
exclusive club for startups. Someone out there clearly

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,760
wants the full story on this guy.

9
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,320
Yeah, and it's a story that goes way beyond

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,100
the typical resume. You know what I mean?

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,340
It's like we're looking at puzzle pieces scattered

12
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,320
across different fields. Software

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,840
development, entrepreneurship, leadership.

14
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,920
Even a hint of,

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,980
dare I say, like positive hacking

16
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,360
in this guy's journey. Positive hacking. I like that.

17
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,300
Okay, let's start piecing this puzzle together

18
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,180
then, shall we? It seems Moustafa's journey

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,320
in tech began pretty far from Silicon

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,280
Valley, born in Egypt. He eventually lands

21
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,160
at Penn State Barron, not exactly

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,180
the first stop on the Tech Career Express.

23
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,320
But here's what's interesting.

24
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,100
He planned to transfer from Barron,

25
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,320
but ended up not just staying,

26
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,440
but becoming the Student Government Association

27
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,460
president twice.

28
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,220
Clearly, something about the place really

29
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,900
hooked him. Okay, that detail

30
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,020
alone is intriguing. But wait, there's

31
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,020
more. We've uncovered this almost

32
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,260
Robin Hood-esque scheme that Moustafa

33
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,960
cooked up. He figured out that starting

34
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,000
clubs was the key to getting funding for,

35
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,320
well, let's just say personal projects.

36
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,640
Personal projects, yes.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,160
But notice how this speaks to his entrepreneurial

38
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,260
spirit. Even back then, he had a need

39
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,980
gaming consoles, photography gear.

40
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,040
And he found a creative way to fulfill it

41
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,880
by navigating the university system.

42
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,160
It's a pattern we'll see again. And it

43
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,040
gets even wilder. Apparently, Moustafa

44
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,760
went all four years of college without

45
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,880
owning a laptop, library, computers, late

46
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,080
night study sessions. That was his life.

47
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,820
There's even this story about him

48
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,680
at a hackathon needing specific

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,660
software but facing admin restrictions,

50
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,620
so he figured out how to bypass them.

51
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,680
Talk about resourcefulness. Now, that

52
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,860
anecdote about the hackathon, it's a glimpse

53
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,540
into how Moustafa approaches challenges.

54
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,920
Right? He encounters an obstacle,

55
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,380
he analyzes the situation,

56
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,920
and uses his technical skills to find

57
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,800
a workaround. Resourcefulness, definitely

58
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,820
a recurring theme here. Now, let's talk about

59
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,460
Moustafa's entrepreneurial ventures,

60
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,880
specifically Muka Wallet. It was an app

61
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,300
designed to help people get out of debt.

62
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,920
What strikes me here is that it wasn't about

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,880
creating just another, like, fintech app.

64
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,220
This felt personal.

65
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,800
Indeed, while we don't have concrete details, you're right to

66
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,120
pick up on that thread. Muka Wallet

67
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,160
suggests a deeper motivation beyond

68
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,960
simply building a successful business.

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,920
It suggests a desire to

70
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,060
tackle a problem with real-world impact,

71
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,180
possibly even one close to his heart.

72
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,040
And that desire to make a difference becomes

73
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,960
even more evident with his next venture,

74
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,560
right? Tell me about

75
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,260
TAR.

76
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,040
TAR was all about empowering Moustafa's

77
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,060
home country. He co-founded

78
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,080
this coding boot camp with the vision of

79
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,260
turning Egypt into a software powerhouse.

80
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,980
He saw the potential in his Y Combinator

81
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,180
application. He even stated that Egypt

82
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,260
only had 10% of the developers it could have.

83
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,700
Wow, 10%, that's a bold statement.

84
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,760
He wasn't just teaching people to code. He

85
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,760
envisioned bridging a massive skills gap while

86
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,800
tackling unemployment and making Egypt a

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,040
global player in tech talk about ambition.

88
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,480
Ambition, yes, but also a strategic

89
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,680
understanding of the future.

90
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,000
He was also a leader in the development

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
of the global landscape.

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,160
Moustafa recognized the increasing demand for

93
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,460
skilled developers worldwide with TAR.

94
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,640
He aimed to solve a problem for Egypt while

95
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,600
positioning the country to capitalize on this

96
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,360
global need.

97
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,460
OK, so we've got this picture of Moustafa,

98
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,020
the resourceful student, the ambitious

99
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,360
entrepreneur, and then he lands at logistics,

100
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,980
plus a global logistics company.

101
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,060
It seems his leadership qualities couldn't be

102
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,360
contained. He joined as a software engineer,

103
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,880
but quickly rose to lead the entire tech team.

104
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,680
Remember his two-time SGA

105
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,040
presidency? Leadership is clearly a theme.

106
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,020
It's not that he stumbles into leadership roles.

107
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,980
He actively seeks them out and excels.

108
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,360
He thrives on taking the reins and guiding a

109
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,720
team towards a shared vision.

110
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,900
It makes me wonder about the work environment

111
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,440
at logistics. Plus, his LinkedIn mentions a

112
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,300
quirky and laid back company culture that's not

113
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,440
your typical corporate environment, especially

114
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,180
for a global company.

115
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,940
And that's a fascinating point.

116
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,220
Could it be that this less conventional

117
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,520
atmosphere resonated with Moustafa's own

118
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,320
personality?

119
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,660
Or perhaps it was the perfect breeding ground

120
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,980
for his creativity and problem solving skills

121
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,640
to flourish?

122
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,800
You've got me thinking.

123
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,040
Now, speaking of problem solving, there's this

124
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,140
almost unbelievable story from his time at

125
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,940
logistics. Plus, apparently a major bug was

126
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,980
impacting a popular food delivery app.

127
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,300
We're talking 20,000 restaurants unable to

128
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,100
receive orders.

129
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,100
Moustafa and his team jumped in and worked

130
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,440
nonstop for 40 hours straight to fix it.

131
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,120
And here's where his ingenuity really shines.

132
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,780
They didn't have an API, which is essentially a

133
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,500
way for different software to work.

134
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,600
So they had to use a software called Microsoft.

135
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:27,660
So they had to use a software called Microsoft.

136
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,920
They had to use a software called Microsoft.

137
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,480
They had to use software systems to talk to each

138
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,320
other to work with.

139
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,680
So they improvised.

140
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,760
Imagine this.

141
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,780
20 computers each running mouse recording

142
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,580
software synced to a Google Sheet.

143
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,180
It sounds utterly bizarre, but it worked.

144
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,900
That's not just problem solving.

145
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,840
It's like MacGyver level ingenuity.

146
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,880
But more importantly, it shows a dedication that

147
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,180
goes beyond just doing your job.

148
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,260
You know, they knew people were relying on that

149
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,700
app and they pulled out all the stops to get it

150
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,300
working again.

151
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,440
It's a testament to his character, wouldn't you

152
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,480
say? He's not just driven by finding these

153
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,600
elegant things.

154
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,260
He's driven by finding these elegant technical

155
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,840
solutions.

156
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,700
There's this deep seated desire to ensure things

157
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,360
work, to help people and to see a problem through

158
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,240
to its resolution, no matter how unconventional

159
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,780
the method.

160
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,980
So we see this incredibly resourceful guy willing

161
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,540
to go to great lengths to make things work.

162
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,440
It makes you wonder with that food delivery app,

163
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
did they have to hit order like 20,000 times?

164
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,540
That image did cross my mind.

165
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,280
I have to admit, though, I suspect they found a

166
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,260
more elegant solution within that controlled

167
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,760
chaos.

168
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,120
Uh huh.

169
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,300
But speaking of elegant solutions.

170
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,740
Mustafa didn't stay at Logistics Plus forever,

171
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,120
did he?

172
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,280
He did not.

173
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,420
And this is where the story takes another

174
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,480
interesting turn from fixing bugs and leading

175
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,100
teams.

176
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,040
Mustafa transitions to consulting for some of the

177
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,260
biggest names in the game at McKinsey and Company.

178
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,640
Talk about a career shift.

179
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,980
It's a natural progression, though, wouldn't you

180
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,480
say?

181
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
He'd honed his technical skills, he'd proven his

182
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,080
leadership, and he demonstrated an ability to

183
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,020
solve complex problems at McKinsey.

184
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,560
He was essentially applying that expertise on a

185
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
larger scale.

186
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,100
Advising the team.

187
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,960
And using these high profile clients on their most

188
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,700
critical issues.

189
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,980
And the impact is clear, right?

190
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,280
We see examples in the material you sent, like he

191
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
helped develop an inventory management tool that

192
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,680
saved a health care client a cool $70 million.

193
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,100
And then there's this AI forecasting tool he built

194
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,960
for a telecom company streamlining their call

195
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,040
center operations.

196
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,520
This is Mustafa connecting his technical prowess

197
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,360
with high level strategy AI forecasting, for those

198
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,780
unfamiliar, is like having a crystal ball for data.

199
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,940
In this case, it allowed the telecom company to

200
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,040
predict call volumes and allocate resources more

201
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
efficiently, ultimately leading to smoother

202
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,620
operations and happier customers.

203
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,480
So we've got Mustafa the coder turned consultant

204
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,840
optimizing systems and saving companies millions.

205
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,140
But let's rewind for a bit.

206
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,180
Remember those Y Combinator applications?

207
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,580
I'm particularly drawn to the one for Mookle Wallet.

208
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,700
Ah, yes.

209
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,660
Mookle Wallet.

210
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,340
A noble endeavor that unfortunately never quite

211
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,060
launched.

212
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,800
And this is where we see that even someone as

213
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,900
driven as Mustafa faces setbacks.

214
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,260
It seems he learned a lot from the Mookle Wallet.

215
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,400
It seems he learned a lot from the Mookle Wallet.

216
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,500
It seems he learned a lot from the Mookle Wallet.

217
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:56,560
It seems he learned a lot from the Mookle Wallet.

218
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:56,620
It seems he learned a lot from the Mookle Wallet.

219
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,160
It seems he learned a valuable lesson from that

220
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,020
experience, though.

221
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,840
In his application, he candidly admits that they

222
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,260
kept trying to perfect Mookle Wallet before

223
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,260
launching, and eventually the momentum fizzled out.

224
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,000
A classic case of over-engineering, a trap many

225
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,540
tech-minded founders fall into.

226
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,080
They get so caught up in building the perfect

227
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,220
product that they forget the importance of getting

228
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,720
it into the hands of users early on, gathering

229
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,820
feedback and iterating.

230
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,140
He even calls it a mistake, saying it taught him

231
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,060
to prioritize getting a product out there over

232
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,180
waiting for it to be perfect.

233
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,400
A valuable lesson for anyone in the tech world,

234
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,060
wouldn't you say?

235
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,780
Absolutely.

236
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,620
And this willingness to acknowledge and learn

237
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,900
from his mistakes is telling.

238
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,600
It's not about always having the right answer.

239
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,820
It's about adapting and growing from the

240
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,020
experiences, even the less successful ones.

241
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,040
It makes you wonder, though, what could Mookle

242
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,740
Wallet have become if it had launched?

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
But let's shift gears for a moment and go back to

244
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,180
Penn State.

245
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,500
We've talked about the clubs and the laptop

246
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,300
situation, but what else can we glean about his

247
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,860
character from those formative years?

248
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,020
There's something to be said about Mookle Wallet.

249
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,160
There's something to be said about Mookle Wallet.

250
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,220
There's something to be said about him being the

251
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,300
first international student to become SGA

252
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,780
president at Behrend and then repeating that feat.

253
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,040
It suggests a natural charisma, an ability to

254
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,220
connect with people from diverse backgrounds, and

255
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,960
a drive to lead.

256
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,520
He wasn't just blending in.

257
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,260
He was actively shaping the community around him.

258
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,200
And remember those personal projects funded by

259
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,560
his club starting scheme.

260
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,420
It might sound funny, but it speaks to his ability

261
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,920
to navigate systems, identify opportunities, and

262
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,640
strategically work towards his goals, even if

263
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,020
those goals were a bit unorthodox at the time.

264
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,520
Exactly.

265
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,020
It's almost like a microcosm of his entrepreneurial

266
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,520
journey.

267
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,000
He sees a need.

268
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,600
He analyzes the available resources and devises a

269
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,640
creative, albeit slightly mischievous, solution.

270
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,320
It's that same ingenuity that we see later when he's

271
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,140
tackling these complex problems at Logistics Plus

272
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,780
and McKinsey.

273
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,580
It's like that saying, it's not about breaking the

274
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,180
rules, but bending them to your will.

275
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,180
Not that we condone rule breaking, of course.

276
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,880
Of course not.

277
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,540
But speaking of bending rules, let's talk about that

278
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,740
positive hacking element we mentioned earlier.

279
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,200
It's clear that Mustafa has a knack for finding

280
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,460
unconventional solutions.

281
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,300
Oh, absolutely.

282
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,140
That food delivery app story is a prime example.

283
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,980
20 computers running mouse recording software.

284
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,980
It's the kind of solution you'd see in a movie

285
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,180
montage, not in a real world business setting.

286
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,040
And yet it worked.

287
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,260
It speaks to his willingness to think outside the

288
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,180
box, to experiment, and to find a solution no matter

289
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,860
how unorthodox when others might have given up.

290
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,540
There's a certain fearlessness in that approach.

291
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,120
And let's not forget that this wasn't some

292
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,620
theoretical solution.

293
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:25,720
It was a theoretical solution.

294
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,260
It was a technical problem.

295
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,080
This was impacting real people relying on that app

296
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,620
for their businesses and livelihoods.

297
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,160
His drive to fix it wasn't just about technical

298
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,640
prowess.

299
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,120
It was about ensuring a positive outcome for

300
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,360
thousands of people.

301
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,480
You're right to highlight that it speaks to a sense

302
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,920
of responsibility that seems to underpin his actions.

303
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,920
He's not just building things for the sake of

304
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,200
building.

305
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,580
He wants his work to have a tangible, positive

306
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,620
impact on the world.

307
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,320
Okay, so we've seen Mustafa, the resourceful

308
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,500
student, Mustafa, the ambitious entrepreneur,

309
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,340
Mustafa, the problem-solving consultant.

310
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,620
But there are other things that we can do to

311
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,120
help him.

312
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,780
There are hints of something more personal in

313
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,280
the material you sent, his social media posts,

314
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,240
for example, paint a picture that goes beyond

315
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,060
code and spreadsheets.

316
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,580
Yes.

317
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,140
We see glimpses of his travels, his love for

318
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,120
music, particularly electronic dance music, if

319
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,400
his pictures from EDC are anything to go by.

320
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
It reminds us that he's not just a collection of

321
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,120
impressive achievements.

322
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,200
He's a person with passions and interests

323
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,160
outside his work.

324
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,740
That makes you want to know more about what

325
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,940
makes him tick, right?

326
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,680
What drives him?

327
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,560
What inspires him?

328
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
What keeps him up at night?

329
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,240
It's like we're seeing the tip of the iceberg and

330
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,060
there's this whole other dimension waiting to be

331
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,740
explored.

332
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,180
It's that unexplored territory that makes this

333
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,680
deep dive so captivating.

334
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,660
We can analyze his career trajectory, his technical

335
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,080
skills.

336
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,960
But ultimately, the question remains, what does

337
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,760
Mustafa truly aspire to?

338
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,000
What mark does he want to leave on the world?

339
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,040
Limitless.

340
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,000
That's a good word for it.

341
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,320
I mean, we started this deep dive wondering who

342
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,940
Mustafa El-Hadari is, and it's like we've uncovered

343
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,960
like multiple Mustafas.

344
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,320
All right.

345
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,380
The resourceful student, the driven entrepreneur, the

346
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,900
problem-solving consultant.

347
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,880
And let's not forget Mustafa the music lover,

348
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,640
venturing out to EDC.

349
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,380
Yeah.

350
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,360
It's a good reminder that behind every impressive

351
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,960
resume, there's a real person, right?

352
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,920
With interests and passions that extend beyond their work.

353
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,460
Totally.

354
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,320
Makes you wonder what he's listening to while he's

355
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,840
coding up those brilliant solutions.

356
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,740
But speaking of those solutions, there's something

357
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,440
about his approach that's both fascinating and instructive.

358
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,380
What I find fascinating is this ability to navigate

359
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,420
different worlds and systems, right?

360
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,440
Like he understands the rules.

361
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,060
He understands the rules of the game, whether it's

362
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,700
the university system, the startup world, or the

363
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,100
corporate environment, and he's not afraid to bend

364
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,300
them to achieve his goals.

365
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,600
Yeah.

366
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,640
It's like he's playing chess while everyone else is

367
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,500
playing checkers, you know, always thinking a few

368
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,220
steps ahead.

369
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,780
And the instructive part.

370
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,780
He reminds us that success isn't always linear.

371
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,080
He's had setbacks like Maka Wallet not launching, but

372
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,700
he's learned from them and come back stronger.

373
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,660
Exactly.

374
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,240
His story is a testament to the power of embracing

375
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,860
failure as a learning opportunity.

376
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,320
He didn't let the disappointment of Maka Wallet derail.

377
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,120
His entrepreneurial spirit.

378
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,060
He channeled that experience into TAR and later

379
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,320
Logistics Plus Egypt.

380
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,320
And that's something we can all take to heart, right?

381
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,060
It's not about avoiding failure.

382
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,700
It's about having the resilience to learn from it

383
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,960
and pivot when needed.

384
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,900
But let's go back to Logistics Plus Egypt for a moment.

385
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,420
It feels like more than just another career move for

386
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,080
Mustafa.

387
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,460
It does, doesn't it?

388
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,000
Hmm.

389
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,200
This time it's personal.

390
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,440
He's combining his expertise in logistics with this

391
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,880
passion for his home country.

392
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,480
You could even argue that he's not just a business man.

393
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,600
He's a business man.

394
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:24,700
He's a business man.

395
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:24,820
He's a business man.

396
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:24,840
He's a business man.

397
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:24,940
He's a business man.

398
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:24,960
He's a business man.

399
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,020
He's a business man.

400
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,080
He's a business man.

401
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:32,220
He's a business man.

402
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,640
And it's also aboutúsica, having a sustainability

403
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:34,740
heart.

404
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,580
At the same time, still familiar with his university

405
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,200
and all the indigenous sciences of the world.

406
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,860
Most of his activities include joining an institute

407
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,960
that dedicated to education, but with the great

408
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,820
impact on education in many localities, andLIEA

409
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,080
ranch.

410
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,200
You could argue that he's cut theateness of all the

411
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,280
issues.

412
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,380
Right.

413
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,720
I'm sure there's more that you could tell us.

414
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,720
know-how and entrepreneurial drive, seems perfectly poised to lead that charge.

415
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,640
So what are you thinking? What's your prediction for Mustafa El-Hadiri,

416
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,780
the man who seems to defy easy categorization?

417
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,020
Well, prediction is a dangerous game, especially with someone as dynamic as Mustafa.

418
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,480
However, based on the evidence, it's clear that he's driven by this desire to build,

419
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,300
to create, to leave a lasting mark.

420
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,800
And that he's not afraid to take risks, to challenge the status quo, to forge his own path.

421
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,940
Exactly. He's shown us that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to success.

422
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,460
He's been a student leader, a tech innovator, a corporate problem solver,

423
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,080
and now a bridge between continents and industries.

424
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,720
And that's what makes his story so inspiring, right?

425
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,080
It reminds us that we don't have to be defined by a single path or a single definition of success.

426
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,460
We can be resourceful, ambitious, and make a real difference, all while pursuing our passions.

427
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,380
Well said.

428
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,580
As we wrap up this deep dive into the world of Mustafa El-Hadiri,

429
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,480
one thing is certain.

430
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,640
This is a story far from over.

431
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,840
In fact, it feels...

432
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,920
It feels like the most exciting chapters are still being written.

433
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,600
And who knows?

434
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,540
Maybe, just maybe, this deep dive will reach Mustafa himself,

435
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,220
and we'll have the opportunity to hear the rest of the story straight from the source.

436
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,780
Until then, we'll be watching his journey with great interest,

437
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,640
inspired by his relentless pursuit of building something meaningful.
